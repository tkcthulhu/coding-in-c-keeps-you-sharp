A terminal based todo list program

So this was an exercise in inheritance and using object properties and methods to create a termianl based to do list where yoiu can add/remove items, view
a list of items, clear that list, and change a password. This was definetly fun and I added some to the original prompt by adding the remove feature, as well as the terminal prompts to make the program interactive from the terminal. Great learning experience!
